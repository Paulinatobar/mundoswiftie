      "descripcion":"Speak Now es una oda a las historias y los cuentos de hadas, sin olvidar que el éxito que vas forjando es la mejor venganza hacia los que te critican y te intentar hundir. El tercer álbum de la artista es el primero que escribió en su totalidad sin la ayuda de coescritores, teniendo 22 canciones en su versión deluxe, la mayoría dedicada a sus antiguas relaciones, incluyendo canciones para Joe Jonas, John Mayer y Taylor Lautner. Si bien contiene tintes de la música country, también mezcla sonidos del pop y el rock. La canción que mejor describe la magia de este álbum es Enchanted, una balada que habla de cómo te interesas por alguien y pides que por favor no esté enamorada de alguien más. Debutó en el puesto número 1 en el Billboard 200 y vendió más de un millón de copias en su primera semana sólo en Estados Unidos, un logro impresionante para una artista joven y que ayudó a cimentar su base de fanáticas, a quienes les escribió con mucho amor la canción Long Live.",

Todas las emociones que este color puede describir son descritas en el cuarto álbum de Taylor: RED. La catarsis en su máxima expresión que produce una ruptura amorosa es descrita en la canción All Too Well (Jake Gyllenhaal no devolvió la bufanda), donde Taylor explora las diversas situaciones en que la relación se veía tóxica pero ella estaba tan enamorada que no pudo verlo con claridad hasta que esta terminó. Así como el amor es complejo, los géneros que explora este álbum son diversos: pop, rock, country y balada. Debutó en el puesto número 1 en el Billboard 200 y vendió más de 1.2 millones de copias en su primera semana en Estados Unidos. El álbum le dio a Taylor reconocimiento internacional en el mundo del pop y fue uno de los discos más vendidos de 2012, sin embargo, pese a estar nominado a los premios Grammy, no obtuvo ninguno.",

      "descripcion":"En el año 1989 nació Taylor Swift y también el nombre del quinto álbum de estudio de la cantante. Este representó un cambio radical en lo que se identificaba a Taylor, siendo un álbum totalmente pop y alejado de letras de desamores y corazones rotos, para centrarse en historias de fiestas, amistades, viajes y enamoramientos. La canción que representa a este álbum es Blank Space, en donde la artista de manera irónica, habla de las críticas que la prensa hace sobre su vida privada, en especial de sus relaciones amorosas. También, en este álbum comienza a trabajar con el producto Jack Antonoff, con quien comienza a definir su estilo musical. Si tuviéramos que definir a 1989 en una frase esta sería: synth pop de los años 80. Ganó el Grammy al Álbum del Año en 2016, convirtiendo a Swift en la primera mujer en ganar este premio dos veces.",

      "descripcion":"Luego del éxito de 1989, Taylor Swift fue el blanco de críticas de diversas personas del mundo del espectáculo debido a polémicas que la involucraron con rostros como Calvin Harris, Kim Kardashian y Kanye West. Esto llevó a que desapareciera de todas las redes sociales. Pero, resurgió de las cenizas con todo y lo hizo a través del álbum reputation. Las serpientes, la venganza, el amor profundo y pasional, y también la ansiedad son los temas principales de esta obra maestra que mezcla sonidos de la música electrónica con el synth pop. El sencillo Look What You Make Me Do representa lo disruptivo que fue este álbum y su video contiene la mayor cantidad de Easter Eggs de todos los videos musicales de la carrera de la artista. A pesar del cariño que los fans le tienen a rep, este álbum no tuvo ninguna nominación a los Grammys. #queremosRepTV",

Lover es el séptimo álbum de la cantante, en donde explora los sentimientos que esta emoción puede producir, siendo Joe Alwyn, su entonces pareja, una de sus fuentes de inspiración. En la canción Lover expresa lo feliz que se siente con él y cómo desea que estén siempre juntos.

      "descripcion":"folklore es el primer álbum pandémico de Taylor Swift, donde vuelve a desafiarse de una manera extraordinaria, al crear un álbum indie/folk y con historias inventadas por ella, dejándose de inspirar principalmente en sus vivencias personales. Este álbum contiene un triángulo amoroso entre James, Betty y Augustine descrito desde la perspectiva de cada uno en las canciones betty, cardigan y august, respectivamente. Los sonidos acústicos de la guitarra y el piano son lo predominante en las canciones. Por otro lado, las letras alcanzan un nivel de poesía y armonía nunca antes visto en otros álbumes de Taylor, es por esto que, para muchos críticos, folklore es la mejor creación de la cantante. Además, Joe Alwyn comienza a participar en la escritura de canciones bajo el seudónimo de William Bovery. En el año 2021, Taylor conquistó su tercer Grammy al Álbum del Año gracias a todos los elementos que construyen esta gran obra maestra.",

      "descripcion":"evermore es el álbum hermano de folklore, ya que salió tan solo 5 meses después de este y comparten el estilo indie/folk, aunque tiene algunos tintes de pop. En sus quince canciones explora diversas temáticas profundas, como la sensación de una relación que no funciona en tolerate it, extrañar y recordar a un ser querido en marjorie o analizar las razones de una ruptura dolorosa en champagne problems. También, de cierta forma, Taylor nos cuenta que no puede dejar de escribir, inventar historias y contarlas a través de melodías y ritmos diversos. Por esto, evermore se encarga de llevarnos a lo desconocido, donde se hacen rituales, crecen flores extrañas, donde viven nuestros anhelos y nuestras frustraciones. No ganó ningún premio importante ya que todos se los llevó folklore, y se dice que es el hijo menos favorito de Taylor",

      "descripcion":"Fearless TV es la primera regrabación que publicó Taylor Swift. Las regrabaciones surgen luego del enfrentamiento que tuvo Taylor con la discográfica Big Machine Records, quienes no permitieron que la cantante pueda ser dueña de sus 6 primeros álbumes y vendieron los derechos a Scooter Braun. Luego de una gran batalla legal, Taylor logró que le permitieran regrabar las canciones de los álbumes involucrados en la disputa, pero ella decidió darle una segunda derivada y además, decidió añadir canciones que escribió en los momentos respectivos de cada álbum que no fueron añadidos en las versiones originales. Estas son las famosas canciones From The Vault. En el caso de Fearless, se añadieron 6 canciones nuevas, donde podemos destacar a Mr. Perfectly Fine, una divertida canción que juega con las palabras para describir al desgraciado ex novio que finge estar mejor que tú. Además, Taylor decidió añadir If This Was A Movie, originalmente de Speak Now. En las nuevas grabaciones se puede notar el crecimiento vocal de Taylor respecto al álbum original y cómo ha mejorado su interpretación de las canciones con el paso de los años.",

Incluye 6 canciones extra, con colaboraciones con Hayley Williams y Fall Out Boy, y tuvo un cambio en la letra de la canción de Better Than Revenge, ya que la versión original era considera controversial. La interpretación vocal madura y texturizada de Taylor en comparación con la realizada en las canciones originales vuelve a ser tema de conversación. Además, lanzó el video musical de la canción I Can See You, donde podemos ver a los actores originales del video de Mean junto a Taylor Lautner, su ex-pareja, demostrando que puede llevarse bien y tener buena relación con ellas (cuando son buenas personas, como Taylor Lautner, te amamos Taylor Lautner).",

         "Foolish One (Taylor's Version)(From The Vault)": "My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand\nChances are, tonight, you've already got plans\nAnd chances are I will talk myself to sleep again\nYou give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high\nWishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right\nAnd I will block out these voices of reason in my head\n\nAnd the voices say, \"You are not the exception\nYou will never learn your lesson\"\n\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will take the long way, you will take the long way down\n\nYou know how to keep me waitin'\nI know how to act like I'm fine\nDon't know what to call this situation\nBut I know I can't call you mine\nAnd it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof\n'Cause when my head is on your shoulder\nIt starts thinkin' you'll come around\nAnd maybe, someday, when we're older\nThis is something we'll laugh about\nOver coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news\n\nBut then the voices say, \"You are not the exception\nYou will never learn your lesson\"\n\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will take the long way, you will take the long way down\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out\n\nNow I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands\nSayin', \"How could I not see the signs?\"\nOh, you haven't written me or called\nBut goodbye screamin' in the silence\nAnd the voices in my head are tellin' me why\n\n'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings\nI'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring\nAnd you will say you had the best of intentions\nAnd maybe I will finally learn my lesson\n\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will take the long way, you will take the long way down\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh\n\nLa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh\nLa-la-la-la-la\nAin't never gonna come\nOoh, you will learn the hard way now\nFoolish one\nSittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love\nThey ain't never gonna come\nAnd thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out\nFoolish one\nThe day is gonna come for your confessions of love\nWhen all is said and done, he just wasn't the one\nNo, he just wasn't the one\n",

      "descripcion":"The Tortured Poets Department es un álbum diferente. Está dividido en dos secciones, de 15 y 16 canciones cada una. Fue anunciado durante el discurso de agradecimiento de Taylor al recibir el Grammy a Mejor Álbum Vocal Pop por Midnights. La gran cantidad de canciones hablan de una ruptura amorosa con todas sus letras, analizando las causas y las consecuencias de esta, pero también de nuevos amores que surgen después de la ruptura, ya sean esporádicos e intensos o más estables y románticos. Nuevamente Taylor nos demuestra que escribe canciones casi por necesidad y nos transporta en un viaje caracterizado por el synth pop, el folk pop y el chamber pop, y nos entrega una historia que ya no es solo de ella al final. Las colaboraciones son con Post Malone en Fortnight y con Florence + The Machine en Florida!!!, ambas canciones especiamente pegadizas e intensas, donde la magia ocurre al escuchar las voces de los intérpretes.",

         "The Manuscript": "Now and then she rereads the manuscript\nOf the entire torrid affair\nThey compared their licenses\nHe said: I'm not a donor but\nI'd give you my heart if you needed it\nShe rolled her eyes and said\nYou're a professional\nHe said: No, just a good samaritan\nHe said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was\nSoon they'd be pushin' strollers\nBut soon it was over\n\nIn the age of him, she wished she was thirty\nAnd made coffee every morning in a French press\nAfterwards she only ate kids' cereal\nAnd couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed\nThen she dated boys who were her own age\nWith dart boards on the backs of their doors\nShe thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years\nEverything had been above board\nShe wasn't sure\n\nAnd the years passed\nLike scenes of a show\nThe Professor said to write what you know\nLookin' backwards\nMight be the only way to move forward\nThen the actors\nWere hitting their marks\nAnd the slow dance\nWas alight with the sparks\nAnd the tears fell\nIn synchronicity with the score\nAnd at last\nShe knew what the agony had been for\n\nThe only thing that's left is the manuscript\nOne last souvenir from my trip to your shores\nNow and then I reread the manuscript\nBut the story isn't mine anymore"

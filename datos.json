      "descripcion":"Speak Now es una oda a las historias y los cuentos de hadas, sin olvidar que el éxito que vas forjando es la mejor venganza hacia los que te critican y te intentar hundir. El tercer álbum de la artista es el primero que escribió en su totalidad sin la ayuda de coescritores, teniendo 22 canciones en su versión deluxe, la mayoría dedicada a sus antiguas relaciones, incluyendo canciones para Joe Jonas, John Mayer y Taylor Lautner. Si bien contiene tintes de la música country, también mezcla sonidos del pop y el rock. La canción que mejor describe la magia de este álbum es Enchanted, una balada que habla de cómo te interesas por alguien y pides que por favor no esté enamorada de alguien más. Debutó en el puesto número 1 en el Billboard 200 y vendió más de un millón de copias en su primera semana sólo en Estados Unidos, un logro impresionante para una artista joven y que ayudó a cimentar su base de fanáticas, a quienes les escribió con mucho amor la canción Long Live.",

Todas las emociones que este color puede describir son descritas en el cuarto álbum de Taylor: RED. La catarsis en su máxima expresión que produce una ruptura amorosa es descrita en la canción All Too Well (Jake Gyllenhaal no devolvió la bufanda), donde Taylor explora las diversas situaciones en que la relación se veía tóxica pero ella estaba tan enamorada que no pudo verlo con claridad hasta que esta terminó. Así como el amor es complejo, los géneros que explora este álbum son diversos: pop, rock, country y balada. Debutó en el puesto número 1 en el Billboard 200 y vendió más de 1.2 millones de copias en su primera semana en Estados Unidos. El álbum le dio a Taylor reconocimiento internacional en el mundo del pop y fue uno de los discos más vendidos de 2012, sin embargo, pese a estar nominado a los premios Grammy, no obtuvo ninguno.",

Este representó un cambio radical en lo que se identificaba a Taylor, siendo un álbum totalmente pop y alejado de letras de desamores y corazones rotos, para centrarse en historias de fiestas, amistades, viajes y enamoramientos. La canción que representa a este álbum es Blank Space, en donde la artista de manera irónica, habla de las críticas que la prensa hace sobre su vida privada, en especial de sus relaciones amorosas. También, en este álbum comienza a trabajar con el producto Jack Antonoff, con quien comienza a definir su estilo musical. Si tuviéramos que definir a 1989 en una frase esta sería: synth pop de los años 80. Ganó el Grammy al Álbum del Año en 2016, convirtiendo a Swift en la primera mujer en ganar este premio dos veces.",

Las serpientes, la venganza, el amor profundo y pasional, y también la ansiedad son los temas principales de esta obra maestra que mezcla sonidos de la música electrónica con el synth pop. El sencillo Look What You Make Me Do representa lo disruptivo que fue este álbum y su video contiene la mayor cantidad de Easter Eggs de todos los videos musicales de la carrera de la artista.

Los sonidos acústicos de la guitarra y el piano son lo predominante en las canciones. Por otro lado, las letras alcanzan un nivel de poesía y armonía nunca antes visto en otros álbumes de Taylor, es por esto que, para muchos críticos, folklore es la mejor creación de la cantante.

También, de cierta forma, Taylor nos cuenta que no puede dejar de escribir, inventar historias y contarlas a través de melodías y ritmos diversos. Por esto, evermore se encarga de llevarnos a lo desconocido, donde se hacen rituales, crecen flores extrañas, donde viven nuestros anhelos y nuestras frustraciones.

Luego de una gran batalla legal, Taylor logró que le permitieran regrabar las canciones de los álbumes involucrados en la disputa, pero ella decidió darle una segunda derivada y además, decidió añadir canciones que escribió en los momentos respectivos de cada álbum que no fueron añadidos en las versiones originales. Estas son las famosas canciones From The Vault. En el caso de Fearless, se añadieron 6 canciones nuevas, donde podemos destacar a Mr. Perfectly Fine, una divertida canción que juega con las palabras para describir al desgraciado ex novio que finge estar mejor que tú.
